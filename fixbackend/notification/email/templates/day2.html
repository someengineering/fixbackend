  <h1> Day 2: Elevate Your Security Insights with Fix </h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to Day 2 of our journey towards securing your digital landscape. As your infrastructure evolves, so do its
    vulnerabilities. It's challenging to predict when a new change might weaken your security defenses. That's where Fix
    steps in â€“ your vigilant partner, dedicated to highlighting potential vulnerabilities the moment they arise.
  </p>

    Fix calculates an overarching score for your cloud accounts, offering you a bird's eye view of your infrastructure's
    security health.
    A score of 100 would signify flawless security alignment with every benchmark.
