Welcome to Fix

Thank you for trusting us to help you secure your cloud environments.
Your journey to a safer, more robust cloud infrastructure starts today.
Since you have been invited by a coworker, here is a quick overview of what Fix is about.


What is CSPM and why do I need it?

In the era of cloud computing, the scale and complexity of cloud resources have escalated dramatically.
With anywhere from a handful to potentially hundreds or even thousands of engineers deploying, modifying,
and managing cloud resources across multiple platforms, the landscape of a company's cloud infrastructure
has become vast and intricate.
This expansion means no single person has full visibility into every asset or configuration within the infrastructure.
It's within this context that Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) becomes indispensable.

CSPM tools like Fix are designed to provide a panoramic view of an organization's cloud security posture,
automating the detection of risks that can stem from:

- Misconfigurations:
  As cloud environments grow, so does the likelihood of misconfigurations.
  Simple oversights in settings can lead to significant vulnerabilities,
  such as exposed data stores or improperly secured compute instances and databases.

- Compliance Drifts:
  With regulations evolving and varying across jurisdictions,
  maintaining compliance in the cloud becomes a moving target.
  CSPM ensures that your infrastructure adheres to the latest standards,
  protecting against penalties and breaches.

- Orphaned Resources:
  Among the most insidious risks are the forgotten, unused, or "orphaned" resources that accumulate over time,
  such as volume snapshots of sensitive data (e.g., customer databases) or unused virtual machines.
  These abandoned assets can not only incur unnecessary costs but also pose significant security
  risks if left unmonitored and unprotected.

Given the dynamic nature of cloud resources, with new services being spun up and down daily,
CSPM serves as an essential system to ensure that every piece of your cloud puzzle is accounted for,
secure, and compliant.
Fix leverages advanced CSPM capabilities to scan and identify potential vulnerabilities across your entire cloud ecosystem,
ensuring not just security, but peace of mind in a landscape where traditional oversight methods no longer suffice.


How does Fix help?

In the complex landscape of cloud infrastructure, Fix stands out as your vigilant partner,
offering comprehensive monitoring and management of your cloud environment.

At the heart of Fix is the inventory of your cloud infrastructure,
a precise mapping of all resources and their interconnections.
This approach enhances visibility and deepens your understanding of the cloud environment's intricate dynamics.
It allows you to see certain misconfigurations at a glance, like load balancers without backends,
or abandoned volumes that are not mounted by a VM.

Our search engine transforms the way you interact with your cloud resources.
Whether you're pinpointing instances with public IPs, identifying aging resources,
or locating too open firewall rules, Fix delivers precise and immediate insights.
This capability extends to full-text searches,
making it possible to swiftly find resources related to specific keywords, such as tags or names.

Beyond search, Fix enhances your data management capabilities.
It allows for the exportation of data for deeper analysis or seamless integration with various
data analysis and management tools, including traditional databases
as well as spreadsheet programs like Excel and Google Sheets.
This flexibility enriches your analytics ecosystem,
ensuring comprehensive and actionable insights across your cloud environment.

A cornerstone of Fix's philosophy is openness and flexibility.
Built on our open-source project "Fix Inventory," we offer unparalleled transparency and control.
This ensures that migrating away from our SaaS, should you choose to,
is hassle-free, reinforcing our commitment to data ownership and vendor independence.
