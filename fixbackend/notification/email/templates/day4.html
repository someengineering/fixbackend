  <h2>Proactive security at your fingertips</h2>

  Upon completing a security scan that identifies new vulnerabilities, Fix utilizes all your specified alerting channels
  to dispatch a consolidated alert for each failing benchmark identified. This alert encompasses details of the checks
  that were not passed, alongside examples of the affected resources, providing a clear picture of the areas requiring
  attention.
