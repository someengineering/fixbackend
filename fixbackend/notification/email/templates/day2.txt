Day 2: Elevate Your Security Insights with Fix

Welcome to Day 2 of our journey towards securing your digital landscape.
As your infrastructure evolves, so do its vulnerabilities.
It's challenging to predict when a new change might weaken your security defenses.
That's where Fix steps in â€“ your vigilant partner, dedicated to highlighting potential vulnerabilities the moment they arise.

Fix is not just a tool; it's your ally in maintaining a robust security posture.
By implementing a comprehensive suite of security benchmarks, Fix evaluates every modification within your infrastructure.
This continuous scrutiny ensures that your security measures always align with the best practices.

Your Security, Visualized

When you navigate to the Security Tab within the Fix app, you're met with insightful metrics.
Fix calculates an overarching score for your cloud accounts, offering you a bird's eye view of your infrastructure's security health.
A score of 100 would signify flawless security alignment with every benchmark.
If you hover over the score you get the number of security issues broken down by severity.

Dive Deep with Detailed Analytics

Our benchmark heatmap provides an in-depth analysis, plotting all your accounts against the established benchmarks.
This visualization allows you to quickly gauge how each account stands in relation to specific security benchmarks, empowering you with the knowledge to make informed decisions.

Monitoring Evolution Over Time

Understanding the dynamic nature of your security posture is crucial.
That's why we highlight not only the quantity of new security issues identified over the last 7 days but also how many have been resolved.
Gain insights into the 'top offenders' by account and resource type, enabling you to focus your efforts where they are needed most.


How to progress from here

In our commitment to not only identify but also solve, Fix offers a prioritized list of issues that, when addressed, will significantly enhance your security posture.
