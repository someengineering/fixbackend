Day 1: Effortless Search, Powerful Insights

Imagine having the ability to pinpoint any resource in your cloud environment within seconds.
With Fix, that's not just possible; it's your new reality.
Our search functionality is designed to streamline your workflows, enhance security, and ensure you're always just a few keystrokes away from finding exactly what you need.

This tutorial assumes that you connected at least one cloud account with Fix.
If not already happened, please visit the setup cloud accounts page in fix and connect your accounts.

Filter by Origin

Log into your Fix account and navigate to the Inventory.
Here, you find dropdowns for the most common filters.
Filter resources by cloud, account, region or zone is straightforward.
You can also narrow down the list of resources by a specific tag.

Filter by Security Severity

Fix analyzes all your resources against different security benchmarks and compliance frameworks.
Fix marks all security vulnerabilities on the resource.
The severity filter now allows you to filter for resources that have vulnerabilities of a specific severity.

Filter by Kind

The Kinds filter allows you to filter resources of a specific service, e.g.
Lambda Functions or IAM roles.
This is the goto filter if you want to narrow down specific resources by specific property filters.

Filter by Property

Every resource kind has its own set of properties.
Fix allows you to filter resources by any property.
Press the + button.
Based on the selected kind of resource, you now see all possible properties.

Once the property is selected, you can define the operation and filter value.
The value dropdown shows all possible values that exist for the selected property in the current search configuration.
