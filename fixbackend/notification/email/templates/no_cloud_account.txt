Connect your cloud accounts


We noticed you haven't added any cloud account to your Fix workspace yet,
and we're here to guide you through this final, crucial step.
It's your gateway to a world of clarity, security, and optimization
for your cloud infrastructure and takes less than 5 minutes.


How to connect your first cloud account

1. Workspace Settings:
   Log in to Fix at https://app.fix.security and locate the Workspace
   Settings icon at the bottom left of your screen.
2. Access Accounts:
   Within the Workspace Settings, you'll find the "Accounts" section.
   Here's where you'll tell us what accounts to scan and turn on/off
   individual accounts and add new ones.
3. Add an Account:
   Look to the top right and click on Add an Account https://app.fix.security/workspace-settings/accounts/setup-cloud .
   Prepare for Deployment: Before moving forward, ensure you're logged into the correct AWS account -
   the one you want us to secure and optimize.
4. Deploy with Ease:
   Click the "DEPLOY STACK" button.
   This opens a new tab leading you to AWS CloudFormation.
   You can stick with the default settings or customize the stack name to your liking.
   Important: The WorkspaceId and ExternalId fields are pre-filled for your convenience.
   Acknowledge the creation of IAM resources by checking the box and hit "Create Stack".
5. Seal the Deal:
   Now, you can close the AWS tab and head back to Fix.
   Our system will spring into action, detecting your new CloudFormation stack.


What's next?

Give us about 20 minutes after the stack creation,
and we'll conduct our first scan of your cloud environment.
We will send you a message when the first scan is complete,
and you can start exploring the insights we've gathered.
