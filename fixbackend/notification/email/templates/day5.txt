Day 5: Exploring the Depths of Fix Together

Congratulations on reaching the fifth and final day of our Fix 101 Series! You've embarked on a comprehensive journey through Fix's features, gaining insights into safeguarding your digital infrastructure.
Yet, there's more to explore.
Let's dive into some of the platform's nuanced capabilities that enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Empower Your Team by Inviting Users to Your Workspace

Security is a team effort, and Fix embraces this by enabling you to bring your colleagues into the fold.
By inviting others to your workspace, you can ensure everyone is aligned and informed.
Assign roles with specific permissions to each user, tailoring their access level from read-only to write, or even admin privileges, to maintain control while fostering collaboration.

Integrate Fix into your CI/CD pipeline or other CLI based workflows

Using our CLI tool fixctl you can export the results of Fix searches in JSON, YAML or CSV format.
Allowing you to write custom logic that takes Fix's data and further processes it in custom ways, depending on your use-cases.
Maximize Coverage by Scraping Your Entire AWS Organization

It is easily possible to scrape your full AWS Organization with Fix.

To add all of your Organization's AWS accounts to Fix, copy the Cloudformation Template URL, External Id and Workspace Id from the Cloud Setup page, and use them to create a StackSet that you deploy to one region in each account that you want to add to Fix.
