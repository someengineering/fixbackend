Your trial period is over, but you can still access your account and data. Please upgrade to continue using Fix.

We noticed you haven't bought a Fix subscription yet.

Easy Steps to get a Fix subscription:

 - Log in to Fix (https://app.fix.security), then navigate to Workspace Settings, and click on the Billing tab.
 - Follow the instructions to add your payment method and subscribe to a plan.


What Happens Next?

If you won't get a subscription, your account will be soon downgraded to the Free plan.
Only a single user will be able to log in, and the data collected about your cloud accounts will no longer be available in Fix.
You will also lose access to the features available in the paid plans.
