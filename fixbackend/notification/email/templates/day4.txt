Alerts are most effective when they seamlessly integrate into your existing workflow.
That's why Fix offers compatibility with a wide array of communication platforms.
Pick the one you use and connect it to Fix.


Proactive security at your fingertips

Upon completing a security scan that identifies new vulnerabilities, Fix utilizes all your specified alerting channels to dispatch a consolidated alert for each failing benchmark identified.
This alert encompasses details of the checks that were not passed, alongside examples of the affected resources, providing a clear picture of the areas requiring attention.
