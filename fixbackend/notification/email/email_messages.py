We noticed you haven't bought a Fix subscription yet.

Easy Steps to get a Fix subscription:

 - Log in to Fix (https://app.fix.security), then navigate to Workspace Settings, and click on the Billing tab.
 - Follow the instructions to add your payment method and subscribe to a plan.


What Happens Next?

If you won't get a subscription, soon after your trial expires your account will downgraded to the Free plan.
Only a single user will be able to log in, and the data we collected about your cloud accounts will no longer be available in Fix.
You will also lose access to the features available in the paid plans.
