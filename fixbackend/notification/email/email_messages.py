How to subscribe:

 - Log in to Fix (https://app.fix.security), then navigate to Workspace Settings, and click on the Billing tab.
 - Follow the instructions to add your payment method and subscribe to a plan.


What happens next?

If you don't purchase a subscription, your account will downgraded to the Free plan after the trial expires.
Only a single user will be able to log in, and the data we collected about your cloud accounts will no longer be available in Fix.
You will also lose access to features only available in paid plans.
